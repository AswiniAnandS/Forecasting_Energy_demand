The objective of this project is to identify the optimal forecasting model for a 2-year energy demand forecast using data from American Electric Power. Various models were employed, including Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing, seasonal ARIMA, regression, classical decomposition, and X11 decomposition. The X11 decomposition model emerged as the winner with a MAPE accuracy of 4.17%.
